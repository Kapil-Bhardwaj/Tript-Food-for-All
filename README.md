# Problem Statement
**INDIA’S HUNGER STATISTICS**

- In India, Hunger kills more people than AIDS, Malaria, and terrorism combined.
- Every 10 seconds, a child dies from hunger.
- One in every eight people sleeps hungry each night.
- According to a report by the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations, every third malnourished child is Indian. 
- The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World, 2020 report says that, ¼ of the world’s undernourished people live in India and we are at 71st position in the  Global Food Security (GFS) Index 2021 from among a list of 113 countries. 

**FOOD WASTAGE AND IRRESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION PATTERN IN INDIA**

- As per the Food Waste Index Report 2021 , a staggering 50 kg of food is thrown away per person every year in Indian homes and Food Wastage Costs India ₹1 Lakh Crore Every Year. 
- India’s estimated 10 million weddings a year,30 to 40 percent of the food served at weddings goes to waste.
- The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) collects around 150 tonnes of leftover food from Hotels and Restaurants in Pune city every day, i.e 54,000 tonnes a year.
- When edible substances are wasted, it is not just the food items that we waste. Resources put into its production are also wasted, as they do not achieve the purpose for which they were used. For example, 20 percent of the land, 32 percent of the energy we produce, and 70 percent of the water we withdraw from lakes, rivers, and underground are wasted because of food wastage.
- The astonishing statistics of food waste attributed to households and their irresponsible consumption patterns.

**GREENHOUSE EMISSION**


- “If wasted food were a country, it would be the third-largest producer of carbon dioxide in the world, after the US and China.” Food wastage accounts for over 7% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions
- The excess food waste usually ends up in landfills where it decomposes anaerobically, uses up oxygen and releases methane and other potent greenhouse gases which exacerbates the climate change crisis with its significant greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint. 
- With less food waste, we can minimise such excessive use of fertilisers, which has huge environmental impacts.
- Not only this, Hotels, banquet halls, restaurants and some thickly populated areas dump food waste in manholes or drain openings connected to manholes which results in sewage-line blocks in many areas. This leads to sanitary blockage and overflowing manholes . Removing food waste from the sewage stream costs money and not removing them is hard on the aquatic environment. 

Hence, Better food waste management will give India both nutritional and environmental security.

# Idea/Solution

Tripti app provides Real-Time Food availability for NGOs, Food quality statistics through Biosensors  and thereby helps neutralise food wastage and mitigate hunger.

**REAL-TIME FOOD AVAILABILITY AND FOOD QUALITY STATISTICS THROUGH BIOSENSORS**
- Food available at our registered and certified Restaurants, Hotels, Corporates, Wedding/Banquet Halls shall update the availability of food with quantity description . 
- The quality and safety of the food shall be measured through bio sensors provided by us and using IoT shall get displayed on App’s dashboard. 
- The SMS Alerts shall be sent to NGOs nearby and the whole process of dispatching and receiving shall get logged on the system. The confirmation button activated by the NGO shall get logged and SMS will be sent to the restaurants/hotels/Corporates/Wedding Halls/Banquet Halls

**DEHYDRATED AND VACUUM PACKING OF SURPLUS FOOD IF ANY**
- The App through AI/ML shall see the availability of surplus food beyond the NGOs confirmation quantity and shall trigger SMS to the registered and certified industries specialising in Dehydrated and Vacuum packed food. This shall be stored in the food bank. The food availability in food bank shall be displayed on App’s dashboard. 80% of available quantity shall be issued to NGOs for feeding and 20% buffer shall be kept for emergency situations

# How we built it?
**Frontend:** Flutter <br>
**Backend:** Currently using Firebase which is a Serverless Backend but in future will use Nodejs, MongoDB, PostgreSQL and AWS Cloud services.
